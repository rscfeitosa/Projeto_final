    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the 
        printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an <strong>printer took a galley</strong> printer took a galley of 
        type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
        It has survived not only five centuries, 
        but also <em>the leap into electronic</em> typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
        in the 1960s with the release<i>of Letraset sheets</i>  
        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
